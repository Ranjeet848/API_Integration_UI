# API_Integration_UI
To develop a simple UI for interacting with the API and testing model outputs, we can create a minimal front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Features:
A text input box for users to input their queries.
A submit button to send the query to the API.
A display area to show the model's response.

How It Works:
User Input: The user enters their query in the text area.
API Call: On clicking the submit button, the query is sent to the API using fetch().
Response Display: The API's response is displayed in the response container.
